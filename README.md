# Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to analyze the different deaths in US cities. (The goal might evolve as we progress on our understanding of the dataset.)

Hence we need to execute the Deaths-In-US-Cities-Analysis.Rmd

To install the project we can simply download the data file from the data folder and the Rmd files:

* Deaths-In-US-Cities-Analysis.Rmd
* Data-Visualization-Using-R-ggplot2.Rmd
* TABLE_III._Deaths_in_122_U.S._cities.csv

To run the project simply run the Rmd files.
